"""
Cleanup script to remove phantom players and fix player database relationships.

ISSUE: Players without a username (not linked to WSO2) were being created,
causing game results to be stored under wrong player IDs.

SOLUTION:
1. Delete phantom players (no username = not linked to WSO2)
2. Re-assign game results to correct WSO2 users
3. Enforce WSO2-only player creation going forward

EXCEPTION: bypass_user is allowed (for local development/testing)
