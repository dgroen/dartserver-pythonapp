# Player Auto-Registration and Game History Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive implementation of four major features for the Darts Game Web/Mobile Application:

1. **Automatic Player Registration** - Users are automatically registered when they log in
2. **Game History Tracking** - Web and mobile pages display user's past game results with statistics
3. **Mobile Results Page Enhancement** - Shows personal history and active games leaderboard
4. **Mobile Gameplay Page Enhancement** - Mirrors web app functionality with current game state and active games

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Service Enhancements

**File**: `/data/dartserver-pythonapp/src/core/database_service.py`

Added four new methods to `DatabaseService` class:

#### `get_or_create_player(username, email=None, name=None)` (Lines 491-529)

- Creates or retrieves a player record from authenticated user data
- Returns player_id, created flag, and player object
- Handles username/email uniqueness and display name updates

#### `get_player_game_history(player_id, game_type=None, limit=50)` (Lines 531-600)

- Fetches paginated game history for a specific player
- Supports filtering by game type (301, 401, 501, Cricket)
- Returns list of completed games with:
  - Game type, start/finish times, duration
  - All players who participated
  - Final scores and winner information
  - Is_winner flag for the queried player

#### `get_player_statistics(player_id)` (Lines 602-680)

- Calculates comprehensive player statistics
- Returns:
  - Total games played
  - Total wins and losses
  - Win rate percentage
  - Average score
  - Per-game-type breakdowns

#### `get_active_games()` (Lines 682-751)

- Queries all currently active games
- Returns games with started_at timestamp but no finished_at timestamp
- Includes:
  - Game type, player count, start time
  - Current score for each player
  - Player names and IDs

### 2. Authentication Integration

**File**: `/data/dartserver-pythonapp/src/app/app.py` (Lines 233-249)

Modified `/callback` route to:

- Call `get_or_create_player()` after successful OAuth2 authentication
- Store `player_id` in Flask session for future requests
- Automatically register the logged-in user in the game lobby

## Technical Decisions

### Database Queries

- Used SQLAlchemy ORM with existing models: `Player`, `GameResult`, `GameType`, `Score`
- Leveraged session storage (`session['player_id']`) for maintaining player context
- Calculated statistics on-demand to ensure always-current data
- Used `isnull()` and `isnot(None)` for proper SQL null comparisons

### API Design

- RESTful endpoints following existing project conventions
- Authentication via `@login_required` decorator
- JSON response format consistent with existing endpoints
- Query parameters for filtering (e.g., `game_type` filter)

### Frontend Architecture

- Tab-based interface for mobile to reduce navigation complexity
- Client-side filtering for responsive UI experience
- Async/await pattern for API calls
- Consistent date formatting (Today/Yesterday/Date format)

### Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach with touch-friendly interfaces
- Consistent color scheme with project's design system
- Proper spacing and typography hierarchy
- Loading states and empty state messages
