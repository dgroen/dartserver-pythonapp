✅ **Results Pages** - Web and mobile interfaces for viewing game history  

## One-Liner Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Set auth bypass
export AUTH_DISABLED=true

# 2. Start app
python run.py

# 3. In another terminal, generate sample data
python helpers/generate_sample_game_data.py

# 4. Visit http://localhost:5000/history or /mobile/results
```

## Sample Data Generator

```bash
python helpers/generate_sample_game_data.py

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| No results showing | Run `python helpers/generate_sample_game_data.py` |
| Auth page appears | Set `AUTH_DISABLED=true` environment variable |
| Database error | Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is set and DB is running |
| No navigation links | Refresh browser, clear cache |

## Files Changed

✅ `templates/index.html` - Added nav links  
✅ `templates/control.html` - Added nav links  
✅ `static/css/style.css` - Added styling  
✅ `static/css/control.css` - Added styling  
✅ `helpers/generate_sample_game_data.py` - NEW helper  
✅ `docs/RESULTS_PAGE_SETUP.md` - NEW documentation  

## Existing Features

These were already in the codebase, now just accessible via links:
- `/history` route with statistics
- `/mobile/results` route with tabs
- API endpoints for game data
- Database storage of games

## Environment Setup

```bash
# .env file
AUTH_DISABLED=true
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/dartsgame
```

## API Endpoints (Dev Use)

```bash
# Get player history
curl http://localhost:5000/api/player/history

# Get statistics
curl http://localhost:5000/api/player/statistics

# Get active games
curl http://localhost:5000/api/active-games
```

## Tips

1. **Refresh to see new games** - After running generator, refresh `/history` page
2. **Mobile view** - Use browser DevTools for testing mobile interface
3. **Sample games** - Generated games have realistic timestamps (in past)
4. **Re-run generator** - Safe to run multiple times (won't create duplicates)
