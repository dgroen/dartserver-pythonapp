| `.env`                                       | Service hostnames (postgres, rabbitmq, wso2is) | Docker containers communicate via service names, not localhost |
| `src/app/app.py` (line 1685)                 | Fixed YAML docstring                           | Swagger couldn't parse multi-line description                  |
| `static/js/mobile_gamemaster.js` (line 122)  | Changed validation from `< 2` to `< 1`         | Allow single-player games                                      |
| `templates/mobile_gamemaster.html` (line 84) | Help text updated                              | User-facing text to match new feature                          |

## What Each Fix Does

### Fix 1: Docker Service Names (.env)

```diff
- DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/dartsdb  # pragma: allowlist secret
+ DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/dartsdb  # pragma: allowlist secret

- RABBITMQ_HOST=localhost
+ RABBITMQ_HOST=rabbitmq
```

**Result**: App can now reach database and message broker in Docker network

### Fix 2: Swagger YAML (src/app/app.py line 1685)

```diff
- description: Initializes a new darts game with specified type and
-             players (mobile-friendly endpoint)
+ description: Initializes a new darts game with specified type and players (mobile-friendly endpoint)
```

**Result**: `/api/docs/` loads without YAML parsing errors

### Fix 3: Single-Player Games (mobile_gamemaster.js line 122)

```diff
- if (playerNames.length < 2) {
+ if (playerNames.length < 1) {
```

**Result**: Users can now play games with just 1 player

### Fix 4: Updated Help Text (mobile_gamemaster.html line 84)

```diff
- <small>Enter at least 2 players</small>
+ <small>Enter at least 1 player</small>
```

**Result**: UI matches new functionality

---

## Deploy Now (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Rebuild Docker Images

```bash
cd /data/dartserver-pythonapp
docker-compose -f docker-compose-wso2.yml build --no-cache
```

### Step 2: Start Services

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-wso2.yml up -d
```

### Step 3: Monitor Startup (wait 30 seconds)

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-wso2.yml logs -f darts-app
```

Look for:

- ‚úÖ `"Database connection OK!"`
- ‚úÖ `"Running on"` (Flask started)
- ‚úÖ No error messages

Press **Ctrl+C** to exit logs.

## Test Each Feature (5 Quick Tests)

### Test 1: Check Swagger API Docs

```
Open: https://letsplaydarts.eu/api/docs/
Expected: Beautiful Swagger UI with all endpoints listed
```

### Test 2: Single-Player Game

```
1. Go to https://letsplaydarts.eu/mobile/gamemaster
2. Enter 1 player name (e.g., "Alice")
3. Click "Start Game"
4. Go to Gameplay tab
Expected: Game displays with 1 player (no error!)
```

### Test 3: Play a Game & Check History

```
1. Play a complete game (301, 401, 501, or Cricket)
2. Go to https://letsplaydarts.eu/history
Expected: Your game appears in the list with statistics
```

### Test 4: Throwout Advice

```
1. Start a 301/401/501 game
2. Click "Show Throw-out Advice" in control panel
3. Play until score < 50
Expected: Finishing tips display (e.g., "Bull for 50")
```

### Test 5: Mobile Real-Time Update

```
1. Go to https://letsplaydarts.eu/mobile/gameplay
2. Have someone submit scores via Game Master or dartboard
Expected: Scores update in real-time
```

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to change anything else in the configuration?

**A:** No, all the critical Docker configuration is already fixed in `.env`. Just rebuild and deploy.

### Q: Will my game data be lost?

**A:** No, PostgreSQL data persists in Docker volumes. Even after stopping containers, your data remains.

### Q: How do I access the application?

**A:** Via `https://letsplaydarts.eu` (or your configured domain). The app is served through nginx reverse proxy.

### Q: What if I want to run this locally without Docker?

**A:** Use the `.env.localhost-http` file as reference and modify `.env` accordingly. Change service names back to localhost.

### Q: Can I play multiplayer games?

**A:** Yes! Single-player games are now allowed, but multiplayer still works. Enter multiple player names to play multiplayer.

### Q: Why two WSO2 URLs?

**A:** WSO2_IS_URL is for browsers (public domain), WSO2_IS_INTERNAL_URL is for the backend (Docker service name). This is more efficient.

## What's NOT Changed (Don't Worry About)

- ‚úÖ Game logic (301, 401, 501, Cricket rules) - unchanged
- ‚úÖ Authentication system - unchanged
- ‚úÖ WebSocket real-time updates - unchanged
- ‚úÖ Text-to-speech - unchanged
- ‚úÖ RabbitMQ integration - unchanged
- ‚úÖ All other features - unchanged

Only the Docker/environment configuration and the small fixes for single-player + Swagger were modified.

---

## Emergency Contacts / Troubleshooting

### If Swagger Still Shows Errors

```bash
# Hard refresh browser
# Or use incognito/private browsing
# Check file: grep "1685" src/app/app.py | grep "and players"
```

### If History Page is Empty

```bash
# Play a game first (at least 1 complete game)
# Then reload the history page
# Check database: docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d dartsdb -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM game;"
```

### If Single-Player Still Blocked

```bash
# Clear browser cache: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
# Check validation: grep "playerNames.length < " static/js/mobile_gamemaster.js
# Restart server: docker-compose restart darts-app
```

### If Services Won't Start

```bash
# Check logs: docker-compose logs
# Rebuild without cache: docker-compose build --no-cache
# Verify .env syntax: python -m py_compile src/core/config.py
```
