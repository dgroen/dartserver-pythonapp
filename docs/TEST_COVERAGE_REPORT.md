## Coverage Improvements by Module

### app.py: 66.67% → 100.00% (+33.33%)

**What was missing**:

- WebSocket event handlers (connect, disconnect, new_game, add_player, etc.)
- `on_score_received` callback
- `start_rabbitmq_consumer` function

**How we fixed it**:

- Created comprehensive WebSocket event tests
- Added unit tests for callback and consumer startup
- Tested both success and error scenarios

### rabbitmq_consumer.py: 13.64% → 98.48% (+84.84%)

**What was missing**:

- Almost all functionality (connection, message processing, error handling)

**How we fixed it**:

- Created complete unit test suite with mocked pika library
- Tested all message processing scenarios
- Tested connection lifecycle and error recovery
- Tested stop/cleanup functionality

### game_manager.py: 92.24% → 97.84% (+5.60%)

**What was missing**:

- Some edge cases in player management
- Certain multiplier types
- Emit methods
- Angle calculation edge cases

**How we fixed it**:

- Added edge case tests for all uncovered branches
- Tested all multiplier types
- Tested all emit methods
- Tested angle calculation for all scores

## Configuration Updates

### pyproject.toml

Updated coverage threshold from 80% to 90%:

```toml
"--cov-fail-under=90"
```

## Key Testing Strategies Used

1. **Mocking External Dependencies**
   - Used `unittest.mock` to mock SocketIO, pika, and threading
   - Isolated units for true unit testing

2. **Fixture-Based Setup**
   - Created reusable fixtures for common test objects
   - Reduced code duplication

3. **Edge Case Coverage**
   - Tested boundary conditions (negative IDs, out of range values)
   - Tested error scenarios (JSON decode errors, connection failures)
   - Tested missing/invalid parameters

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Tested complete workflows via WebSocket
   - Tested REST API endpoints
   - Tested game scenarios end-to-end

5. **Branch Coverage**
   - Used `--cov-branch` to ensure all code paths tested
   - Covered both success and failure branches

## Remaining Uncovered Code

The small amount of uncovered code (2.92%) consists of:

- Some unreachable branch combinations in game logic
- setup.py (not part of application code)
- Exit conditions in loops that are hard to test without integration

These are acceptable and don't impact the application's reliability.

## Continuous Integration

The test suite is configured to:

- ✅ Fail if coverage drops below 90%
- ✅ Generate HTML, XML, and terminal coverage reports
- ✅ Run on multiple Python versions (3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- ✅ Include branch coverage analysis

## Conclusion

The test coverage has been successfully increased from 79.90% to **97.08%**, exceeding the 90% target. The test suite now provides:

- ✅ Comprehensive coverage of all major modules
- ✅ 162 passing tests with 0 failures
- ✅ Fast execution (~2 seconds)
- ✅ Clear test organization
- ✅ Easy to maintain and extend
- ✅ Confidence in code quality and reliability

All tests pass consistently across Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.
