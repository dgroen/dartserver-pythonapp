## Quick Start for New Developers

### 1. Install UV (if not already installed)
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### 2. Run Automated Setup
```bash
./setup-dev.sh
```

This will:
- Create a virtual environment at `.venv`
- Install all dependencies using UV
- Set up pre-commit hooks
- Verify the installation

### 3. Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=term --cov-report=html

# Or use make
make test
```

---

## Tools Configured

### 1. UV Package Manager (v0.8.22)
- **10-100x faster** than pip
- Configured in `pyproject.toml`
- All dependencies managed through UV

**Usage:**
```bash
uv pip install <package>
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv pip list
```

### 2. Testing Framework
- **pytest** - Test runner
- **pytest-cov** - Coverage reporting
- **pytest-mock** - Mocking support
- **Minimum coverage**: 80% (configurable in `pyproject.toml`)

### 3. Linting Tools (7 tools)

| Tool | Purpose | Configuration |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Ruff** | Fast Python linter & formatter | `pyproject.toml` |
| **Black** | Code formatter | `pyproject.toml` |
| **isort** | Import sorter | `pyproject.toml` |
| **Flake8** | Style guide enforcement | `.flake8` |
| **MyPy** | Static type checker | `pyproject.toml` |
| **Pylint** | Code analysis | `pyproject.toml` |
| **Bandit** | Security linter | `pyproject.toml` |

**All tools configured with 100-character line length for consistency**

### 4. Tox Environments

| Environment | Python Version | Purpose |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| `py310` | 3.10 | Run tests on Python 3.10 |
| `py311` | 3.11 | Run tests on Python 3.11 |
| `py312` | 3.12 | Run tests on Python 3.12 |
| `lint` | 3.10 | Run all linting tools |
| `type` | 3.10 | Run type checking (MyPy) |
| `security` | 3.10 | Run security checks (Bandit) |

**Run all environments:**
```bash
tox
```

**Run specific environment:**
```bash
tox -e py310
tox -e lint
tox -e type
```

### 5. Pre-commit Hooks (Two-Stage System)

**Unique Feature**: First commit checks and fails, second commit auto-fixes.

**Hooks configured:**
- Trailing whitespace removal
- End-of-file fixer
- YAML syntax check
- Large file prevention
- Ruff linting
- Black formatting
- isort import sorting
- MyPy type checking
- Bandit security scanning
- detect-secrets

**Usage:**
```bash
# Install hooks
pre-commit install

# Run manually
pre-commit run --all-files

# First commit attempt - will check and fail if issues found
git commit -m "Your message"

# Second commit attempt - will auto-fix issues
git commit -m "Your message"
```

---

## Daily Development Workflow

### 1. Start Development
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Pull latest changes
git pull

# Install any new dependencies
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Make Changes
```bash
# Write code
# Write tests

# Run tests frequently
pytest tests/unit/test_your_module.py -v

# Check coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=term
```

### 3. Before Committing
```bash
# Run linting
make lint

# Run all tests
make test

# Or use tox for comprehensive check
tox -e py310,lint
```

### 4. Commit Changes
```bash
# Stage changes
git add .

# First commit (will check and may fail)
git commit -m "Your descriptive message"

# If it fails, commit again (will auto-fix)
git commit -m "Your descriptive message"
```

```bash
python --version
```

**Test on all versions with tox:**
```bash
tox -e py310,py311,py312
```

## Troubleshooting

### UV Not Found
```bash
# Install UV
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Add to PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Add to shell profile for persistence
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Virtual Environment Issues
```bash
# Remove and recreate
rm -rf .venv
./setup-dev.sh
```

### Test Failures
```bash
# Run with verbose output
pytest tests/ -vv

# Run specific test
pytest tests/unit/test_game_301.py::TestGame301::test_specific_case -vv

# Run with debugging
pytest tests/ --pdb
```

### Pre-commit Hook Issues
```bash
# Reinstall hooks
pre-commit uninstall
pre-commit install

# Clear cache
pre-commit clean

# Run manually to see errors
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Tox Issues
```bash
# Recreate tox environments
tox -r

# Run with verbose output
tox -v
```

## Key Features

### 1. Fast Package Management
UV is **10-100x faster** than pip, making dependency installation nearly instantaneous.

### 2. Comprehensive Testing
- 98 tests covering unit and integration scenarios
- Mocked external dependencies (RabbitMQ, SocketIO)
- Fast test execution (~5 seconds for full suite)

### 3. Multi-Version Support
Tox ensures compatibility across Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.

### 4. Code Quality Enforcement
7 different linting tools ensure:
- Consistent formatting
- Type safety
- Security best practices
- PEP 8 compliance
- Import organization

### 5. Unique Pre-commit System
Two-stage hooks provide:
- First attempt: Check and report issues
- Second attempt: Auto-fix issues
- Prevents bad code from being committed

### 6. Developer-Friendly
- One-command setup
- Comprehensive documentation
- Make commands for common tasks
- Clear error messages

---

## Next Steps

### For New Developers
1. Run `./setup-dev.sh`
2. Read `DEVELOPMENT.md`
3. Read `TESTING.md`
4. Run `make test` to verify setup
5. Start coding!

### For CI/CD Integration
1. Use `tox` in CI pipeline
2. Enforce 80% coverage minimum
3. Run security scans with Bandit
4. Test on all Python versions

### For Production Deployment
1. Use `requirements.txt` for production dependencies
2. Set environment variables for RabbitMQ and SocketIO
3. Run with production WSGI server (gunicorn)
4. Monitor coverage and test results

---

## Important Notes

### Turn-Based Game Logic
The GameManager implements a turn-based system where:
- After 3 throws, `_end_turn()` is called which sets `is_paused = True`
- `next_player()` must be called to unpause and continue
- This is critical for integration tests

### Coverage Testing
Running individual test files will show low coverage because they only test specific modules. Always run the full test suite (`pytest tests/`) for accurate coverage metrics.

### UV Usage
Always use `uv pip install` instead of `pip install` for consistency and speed.

### Pre-commit Hook Behavior
The two-stage system is unique - first commit attempt checks and fails, second attempt auto-fixes. This may need explanation to new developers.
