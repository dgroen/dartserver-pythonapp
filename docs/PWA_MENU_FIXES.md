# PWA and Menu Fixes - Mobile Game Master

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ PWA "Install as App" Not Available

**Problem:** The Mobile Game Master page couldn't be installed as a PWA app on Android Chrome.

**Root Cause:** Missing Service Worker registration in `mobile_gamemaster.html`.

**Solution:** Added Service Worker registration code to enable PWA functionality:

```javascript
if ("serviceWorker" in navigator) {
  window.addEventListener("load", () => {
    navigator.serviceWorker
      .register("/static/service-worker.js")
      .then((registration) => {
        console.log(
          "✅ Service Worker registered successfully:",
          registration.scope,
        );
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error("❌ Service Worker registration failed:", error);
      });
  });
}
```

**Files Modified:**

- `/templates/mobile_gamemaster.html` - Added Service Worker registration

### 2. ✅ Menu Not Working on Gameplay Page

**Problem:** The mobile gameplay page had no menu button, making it impossible to navigate to Game Master or other pages.

**Root Cause:** The `mobile_gameplay.html` template was missing:

- Menu toggle button (☰)
- Navigation menu structure
- Menu overlay
- JavaScript for menu functionality

**Solution:** Added complete menu system matching other mobile pages:

- Added menu toggle button in header
- Added navigation menu with all links including Game Master
- Added menu overlay for closing
- Added JavaScript for menu toggle functionality
- Added Service Worker registration for PWA

**Files Modified:**

- `/templates/mobile_gameplay.html` - Added complete menu system

---

### 3. ✅ Game Master Not Prominent on Home Page

**Problem:** Game Master wasn't easily accessible from the mobile home page quick actions.

**Solution:** Added Game Master as a quick action card on the home page.

**Files Modified:**

- `/templates/mobile.html` - Added Game Master quick action card
