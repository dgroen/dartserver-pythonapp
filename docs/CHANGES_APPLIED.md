# Build Structure Changes - Summary

## ✅ Changes Successfully Applied

All build processes have been reorganized to use the new directory structure.

### New Directory Structure

```
dartserver-pythonapp/
├── docs/                          # All documentation
│   ├── source/                    # Documentation source files
│   ├── build/                     # Generated documentation (gitignored)
│   └── README.md                  # Documentation guide
│
├── build/                         # All build artifacts
│   ├── coverage/                  # All coverage files

### Files Modified

1. **pyproject.toml**
   - Updated coverage output paths
   - Updated pytest junit-xml path
   - Added build/ and docs/ to exclusions
   - Set coverage data_file location

2. **tox.ini**
   - Updated COVERAGE_FILE environment variable
   - Updated all coverage report paths
   - Updated junit-xml paths
   - Updated docs build paths
   - Updated clean command to preserve .gitkeep files

3. **Makefile**
   - Updated test-cov target
   - Updated coverage target
   - Updated clean target to preserve .gitkeep files
   - Added docs target

4. **.gitignore**
   - Updated to ignore build artifacts while preserving structure
   - Added docs/build/ and docs/source/\* patterns
   - Preserved .gitkeep files

### Files Created

- `docs/README.md` - Documentation guide
- `docs/source/.gitkeep` - Preserves directory
- `build/README.md` - Build directory guide
- `build/coverage/.gitkeep` - Preserves directory
- `build/reports/.gitkeep` - Preserves directory
- `BUILD_STRUCTURE_CHANGES.md` - Detailed change documentation
- `migrate_build_structure.sh` - Migration script
- `CHANGES_APPLIED.md` - This file

### Old Files Cleaned Up

The following old files/directories were removed:

- `htmlcov/`, `htmlcov-py310/`, `htmlcov-py311/`, `htmlcov-py312/`
- `coverage/`
- `coverage.xml`, `coverage.json`, `coverage-py*.xml`
- `junit-py*.xml`
- `.coverage`, `.coverage.py*`

## Testing

All changes have been tested and verified:

✅ Coverage reports generate in `build/coverage/`
✅ Test reports generate in `build/reports/`
✅ Clean command preserves `.gitkeep` files
✅ All Makefile targets work correctly
✅ All tox environments configured correctly

## Usage

All existing commands work exactly as before:

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
make test-cov

# Generate coverage report
make coverage

# Run all tests
make test

# Run tox
make tox

# Build documentation
make docs

# Clean build artifacts (preserves .gitkeep files)
make clean
```

## Benefits

✅ **Organized Structure** - All artifacts in logical locations
✅ **Clean Root Directory** - No scattered build files
✅ **Git-Friendly** - Directory structure preserved with .gitkeep
✅ **CI/CD Ready** - Standard paths for build artifacts
✅ **Easy Cleanup** - Single command cleans all artifacts
✅ **Documentation Centralized** - All docs in docs/ folder

## Migration

If you need to migrate an existing checkout:

```bash
./migrate_build_structure.sh
```

This will clean up old artifacts and create the new structure.
