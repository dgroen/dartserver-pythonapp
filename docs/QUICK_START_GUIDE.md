# Quick Start Guide - Auto-Registration & History Implementation

## What's New?

You now have:

1. âœ… **Automatic player registration** when users log in
2. âœ… **Game history page** at `/history` showing all past games
3. âœ… **Mobile results enhancement** with personal stats and active games leaderboard
4. âœ… **Mobile gameplay enhancement** with active games browsing

## How to Test

### 1. Test Auto-Registration

```bash
# Start the application
python app.py

# Login through WSO2
# User will be automatically registered in the game lobby
# Check database: SELECT * FROM players;
```

### 2. Test Web History Page

- Navigate to: `http://localhost:5000/history`
- Should see:
  - Statistics boxes (Games, Wins, Win Rate, Avg Score)
  - Game type filter dropdown
  - Past games with player scores

### 3. Test API Endpoints

```bash
# Player History
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/player/history

# Player Statistics
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/player/statistics

# Active Games
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/active-games
```

### 4. Test Mobile Results Page

- Open: `/mobile/results`
- Test tabs: "ðŸ“œ Your History" and "ðŸ”¥ Active Games"
- Filter by game type
- View active games leaderboard

### 5. Test Mobile Gameplay Page

- Open: `/mobile/gameplay`
- Test tabs: "ðŸŽ® Current Game" and "ðŸ”¥ Active Games"
- Browse active games while a game is running

## Testing with Example Data

To test with game data, ensure:

1. Create a game session
2. Add multiple players
3. Submit some scores
4. View history/statistics
5. Start a new game while keeping one active

## Troubleshooting

### No history showing?

- Ensure user is logged in
- Check if games exist in database: `SELECT * FROM game_results;`
- Verify player_id is correctly set in session

### API returns 401?

- User not authenticated, login first
- Check WSO2 authentication configuration

### Stats showing zeros?

- User may not have played any games yet
- Check database for completed games: `SELECT * FROM game_results WHERE finished_at IS NOT NULL;`

### Styling issues?

- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Ensure CSS file loaded: Check network tab in DevTools
- Verify `/static/css/mobile.css` exists

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: Push changes to production
2. **Test**: Run full integration test suite: `pytest tests/`
3. **Monitor**: Check logs for any errors
4. **User Guide**: Share `/history` page link with users
