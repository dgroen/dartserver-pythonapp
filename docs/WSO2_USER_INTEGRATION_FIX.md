# WSO2 User Integration & History Display Fix

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address:

1. ✅ Game history/results/statistics not displaying
2. ✅ User email and username not filled when players are added
3. ✅ Missing user validation against WSO2
4. ✅ Incorrect display of WSO2 user IDs instead of usernames
5. ✅ Missing WSO2 user autocomplete/search for player selection

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: History/Results/Statistics Not Showing

**Root Cause**: The history API endpoints (`/api/player/history` and `/api/player/statistics`) require a `player_id` from the session, but when players were added to games through the UI, they were not being stored in the database with proper linking.

**Solution**:

- Added `get_or_create_player()` method to DatabaseService to create or retrieve players from the database
- Added `add_player_with_id()` method to GameManager to track database player IDs
- Modified `/api/players` POST endpoint to store player information with email and username
- Player records now include WSO2 integration (username and email fields)

### Issue 2: Email/Username Not Populated

**Root Cause**: When adding players, the system only stored the player name but ignored WSO2 user details.

**Solution**:

- Integrated WSO2 SCIM2 API for user lookup
- Added `get_wso2_user_info()` function in auth.py to fetch user details by username
- When a player is added via WSO2 username, their email and full name are automatically retrieved and stored
- Database Player model already had `username` and `email` fields (now being used)

### Issue 3: No WSO2 User Validation

**Root Cause**: Any arbitrary name could be entered as a player, with no validation against WSO2.

**Solution**:

- Added `search_wso2_users()` function in auth.py to query WSO2 for available users
- Created new API endpoint `/api/wso2/users/search` for frontend autocomplete
- Enhanced player addition to validate usernames against WSO2 before adding

### Issue 4: Showing WSO2 User ID Instead of Username

**Root Cause**: Player names were being displayed without any mapping to friendly usernames.

**Solution**:

- Now stores proper username from WSO2 in database
- Players can select from WSO2 users with real names and emails visible
- Frontend displays user-friendly names instead of system IDs

## Files Modified

### 1. `/data/dartserver-pythonapp/src/core/auth.py`

**New Functions Added**:

- `search_wso2_users(query)` - Search WSO2 for users matching a query

- Shows search results with user name and email
- Maintains ability to enter manual names if preferred

### 6. `/data/dartserver-pythonapp/static/js/control.js`

**New Features**:

- WSO2 user search with 2-character debounce
- Dropdown display of matching users
- Selection handler that populates input with chosen user
- Enhanced `addPlayerBtn` click handler:
  - Validates via new `/api/players` endpoint
  - Handles both WSO2 and manual entries
  - Provides error feedback

## API Changes

### New Endpoint: GET /api/wso2/users/search

```bash
curl -X GET \
  "http://localhost:5000/api/wso2/users/search?q=john" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "username": "john.doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "name": "John Doe"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Modified Endpoint: POST /api/players

**WSO2 User Addition** (recommended):

```json
{
  "username": "john.doe"
}
```

**Manual Player Addition** (fallback):

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe"
}
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Player added",
  "player": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
  }
}
```

## Database Changes

### Player Model

The existing Player model now fully utilized:

```python
class Player(Base):
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String(100), nullable=False)
    username = Column(String(100), unique=True, nullable=True)  # WSO2 username
    email = Column(String(255), unique=True, nullable=True)      # WSO2 email
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=utc_now)
```

## Workflow Changes

### Before (Manual Process)

1. User clicks "Add Player"
2. Types arbitrary name
3. Player added to game (no database record)
4. Game history not available

### After (WSO2 Integrated)

1. User starts typing in "Add Player" field
2. System searches WSO2 and shows matching users
3. User selects from dropdown (shows name + email)
4. System validates with WSO2, retrieves full user info
5. Player stored in database with username + email
6. Game history now shows proper player names and emails

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test WSO2 user search autocomplete
  - Type partial username in player field
  - Verify dropdown appears with matching users
  - Verify names and emails are displayed

- [ ] Test player addition from WSO2
  - Select user from dropdown
  - Click "Add Player"
  - Verify user added with correct name

- [ ] Test manual player addition (fallback)
  - Clear search results
  - Type manual name
  - Add player
  - Verify manual entry works

- [ ] Test game history display
  - Play a game with WSO2 users
  - Navigate to History page
  - Verify game appears with correct player names
  - Check statistics are accurate

- [ ] Test error handling
  - Search for non-existent user (should return no results)
  - Try to add user that doesn't exist (should show error)
  - Check console for no JavaScript errors

## Configuration

The system uses environment variables already configured:

- `WSO2_IS_INTERNAL_URL` - WSO2 internal URL for SCIM2 API calls
- `WSO2_IS_INTROSPECT_USER` - Admin username for server-to-server API calls
- `WSO2_IS_INTROSPECT_PASSWORD` - Admin password for server-to-server API calls
- `WSO2_IS_VERIFY_SSL` - SSL verification for WSO2 connections

## Deployment Notes

1. **Database Migration** (if needed):
   - Existing Player records continue to work
   - Username and email fields are nullable for backward compatibility
   - No schema changes required

2. **WSO2 Configuration**:
   - Ensure admin credentials in `.env` have permissions to query SCIM2 Users endpoint
   - Verify `/scim2/Users` endpoint is accessible from the application

3. **Frontend Updates**:
   - Clear browser cache if search dropdown doesn't appear
   - Check browser console for any CORS errors with WSO2

## Performance Considerations

- Search is debounced (300ms) to reduce API calls to WSO2
- Results limited to 100 users per search
- Caching at database level for frequently played users
- No performance impact on existing game functionality

## Future Enhancements

1. **User Caching**: Cache WSO2 user lookups to reduce API calls
2. **Recent Players**: Show recently added players at top of search
3. **Bulk User Import**: Allow importing player roster from WSO2 group
4. **User Preferences**: Store favorite players for quick access
5. **Email Notifications**: Notify players of game results using stored emails

## Troubleshooting

### Search returns no results

- Check WSO2 credentials in `.env`
- Verify SCIM2 endpoint is accessible
- Check WSO2 admin logs for authentication failures

### Cannot add player error

- Verify user exists in WSO2
- Check network connectivity to WSO2
- Review application logs for error details

### History still not showing

- Confirm player records created in database
- Check game results are being saved to database
- Verify player_id in session is set correctly

## Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check application logs at `logs/app.log`
2. Review WSO2 logs for authentication issues
3. Check browser console for frontend errors
4. Verify database connectivity and records
