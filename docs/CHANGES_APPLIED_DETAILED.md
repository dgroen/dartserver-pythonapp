# Detailed Changes Applied

## Files Modified

### 1. src/core/auth.py

**Lines Added: ~150**

Added two new functions for WSO2 integration:

#### `search_wso2_users(query: str, access_token: str = None) -> list[dict]`

- **Purpose**: Search for users in WSO2 using SCIM2 API
- **Parameters**:
  - `query`: Search term (username, email, or name)
  - `access_token`: Optional bearer token (uses admin credentials if not provided)
- **Returns**: List of matching users with id, username, email, and name
- **Features**:
  - Filters on multiple fields (username, email, given name, family name)
  - Limits results to 100 users
  - Uses admin credentials for server-to-server auth
  - Proper error handling and logging

#### `get_wso2_user_info(username: str, access_token: str = None) -> dict | None`

- **Purpose**: Get detailed info for a specific WSO2 user
- **Parameters**:
  - `username`: Username to look up
  - `access_token`: Optional bearer token
- **Returns**: User dict or None if not found
- **Features**:
  - Exact username match (uses SCIM2 filter)
  - Extracts email from first email in user's list
  - Extracts full name from given+family names
  - Returns None if user not found

### 2. src/core/database_service.py

**Lines Added: ~52**

Added one new method to DatabaseService class:

#### `get_or_create_player(name, username=None, email=None) -> Player | None`

- **Purpose**: Get existing player or create new one
- **Logic**:
  1. If `username` provided → check if player exists by username
  2. Else if `email` provided → check if player exists by email
  3. If found → update with new name/email if provided
  4. If not found → create new player record
- **Returns**: Player database object with ID (or None if error)
- **Features**:
  - Deduplicates by username or email
  - Updates existing records
  - Creates new records as fallback
  - Proper error handling

### 3. src/app/game_manager.py

**Lines Added: ~23**

Added new method to GameManager class:

#### `add_player_with_id(name=None, db_player_id=None) -> None`

- **Purpose**: Add player while tracking database ID
- **Logic**:
  1. Generate default name if not provided
  2. Check Cricket max players (4)
  3. Create player dict with name, game ID, and optional db_id
  4. Add to players list
  5. Add to game object if game exists
  6. Emit game state
  7. Emit TTS sound
- **Difference from `add_player()`**: Stores `db_id` in player object for later use

### 4. src/app/app.py

**Changes**:

- **Line 43**: Added `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`
- **Lines 512-560**: Added new endpoint `GET /api/wso2/users/search`
- **Lines 563-658**: Modified endpoint `POST /api/players` to support WSO2 users

#### New Endpoint: GET /api/wso2/users/search

- **Route**: `/api/wso2/users/search?q=<query>`
- **Auth**: Requires login
- **Logic**:
  1. Get query parameter `q`
  2. Validate query is at least 1 character
  3. Call `search_wso2_users(query)`
  4. Return results as JSON
- **Returns**:

  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "users": [
      {
        "id": "...",
        "username": "john.doe",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com",
        "name": "John Doe"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

#### Modified Endpoint: POST /api/players

**New Parameters**:

- Can now accept `username` (for WSO2 users) OR `name` (for manual)
- If `username` provided:
  1. Call `get_wso2_user_info(username)`
  2. Validate user exists in WSO2 (return 404 if not)
  3. Get WSO2 user's name and email
  4. Call `db_service.get_or_create_player()` with all details
  5. Call `add_player_with_id()` with database ID
- If `name` provided (manual):
  1. Call `get_or_create_player()` with just name
  2. Call `add_player_with_id()` with database ID
- **Returns**:
  - 200: Player added with name and email
  - 404: User not found in WSO2
  - 500: Server error

### 5. templates/control.html

**Changes**:

- **Lines 62-69**: Updated player input section
  - Added wrapper div with position: relative
  - Added hidden dropdown for search results
  - Changed placeholder text to indicate both search and manual entry
  - Dropdown shows search results below input

```html
<div style="position: relative; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
  <input
    type="text"
    id="player-name"
    placeholder="Search WSO2 users or enter manual name..."
  />
  <div
    id="player-search-results"
    style="display: none; position: absolute; ..."
  >
    <!-- Search results will appear here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### 6. static/js/control.js

  - Click handler to select user
  - Click-outside handler to close dropdown
- **Lines 123-156**: Enhanced add player button

## API Workflow

### Before Changes

```
User Input → Socket Event → GameManager.add_player(name) → No database save
```

### After Changes

```
User Input → WSO2 Search API → Dropdown Display → User Selection
    ↓
HTTP POST /api/players → WSO2 Lookup → Database Create → Socket Emit
    ↓
GameManager.add_player_with_id(name, db_id) → Game State Broadcast
```

## Database State

### Before

```
Game Started
├── Player 1 (in memory only)
├── Player 2 (in memory only)
└── No database records
```

### After

```
Game Started
├── Player 1 (in memory + database with email/username)
├── Player 2 (in memory + database with email/username)
└── GameResult records link to Player database IDs
```

## Frontend Flow

### Player Addition Before

```
1. User types name in text field
2. User clicks "Add Player"
3. Player added to game
4. No validation, no email, no feedback
```

### Player Addition After

```
1. User starts typing in text field
2. After 300ms, search results appear below
3. Shows matching WSO2 users with names and emails
4. User clicks desired user from dropdown
5. Name populated in input field
6. User clicks "Add Player"
7. System validates with WSO2
8. System shows success/error message
9. Player added with all details stored
```

## Error Handling

### New Error Cases Handled

- WSO2 connection failures → Error message to user
- User not found in WSO2 → 404 error with helpful message
- Search query too short → Ignored (< 2 chars)
- Network timeouts → Graceful fallback
- Invalid JSON response → Logged and ignored

### Backward Compatibility

- Manual player entry still works
- Old games with legacy players unaffected
- No database migration required
- New fields (username, email) are optional

## Performance Impact

### Search

- Debounced to 300ms (won't fire on every keystroke)
- Results limited to 100 users
- No search results for queries < 2 characters
- Browser-side UI updates (no server rendering)

### Player Addition

- One SCIM2 API call to WSO2 (only when username provided)
- One database insert/update (minimal)
- No impact on game performance
- No impact on existing features

### Total Impact

- ~500ms additional wait for user search (acceptable)
- Negligible memory overhead
- No impact on game latency/responsiveness

## Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Search Autocomplete**
   - Type "de" in player field
   - Should see matching users
   - Should show name and email

2. **Select from Search**
   - Click on user in dropdown
   - Name should populate
   - Dropdown should close

3. **Add WSO2 User**
   - Select user from search
   - Click "Add Player"
   - Should succeed
   - Should emit socket event

4. **Add Manual Player**
   - Clear search results (backspace)
   - Type manual name
   - Click "Add Player"
   - Should succeed as fallback

5. **History Display**
   - Play a game with WSO2 users
   - Navigate to /history
   - Should show game with correct player names
   - Should show statistics

### Unit Test Coverage Areas

- `search_wso2_users()` with various queries
- `get_wso2_user_info()` with valid/invalid usernames
- `get_or_create_player()` create/update logic
- `/api/wso2/users/search` endpoint
- `/api/players` endpoint with both parameter types
- Frontend search and selection logic

## Rollback Plan (if needed)

1. Revert the 5 modified files to previous versions
2. Restart Docker container
3. No database cleanup needed (new fields ignored if unused)
4. All existing functionality would still work

## Version Notes

- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- New endpoints are additive only
- Backward compatible with old client code
- All changes are opt-in on frontend
