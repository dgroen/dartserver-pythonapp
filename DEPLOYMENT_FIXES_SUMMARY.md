# Deployment Fixes Summary - WSO2 Integration & History Display

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Game History Not Displaying

The history/results/statistics pages were empty because:

- Players added to games weren't being stored in the database
- Player IDs weren't being tracked in the session
- The history API had no data to return

**Fixed By**: Now when players are added, they are stored in the database with proper IDs.

### ✅ Issue 2: Email and Username Not Filled In

When adding players, their email addresses and usernames from WSO2 weren't being captured.

**Fixed By**:

- New WSO2 user search functionality
- Automatic retrieval of email and name from WSO2
- Database storage of username and email fields

### ✅ Issue 3: No User Validation Against WSO2

Anyone could add any player name without validation.

**Fixed By**:

- New `/api/wso2/users/search` endpoint for user lookup
- Frontend autocomplete that searches WSO2
- Validation before adding players

### ✅ Issue 4: Showing "<Dennis@carbon.super>" Instead of Username

The system was displaying WSO2 user IDs instead of friendly names.

**Fixed By**:

- Storing proper usernames from WSO2
- Users can now select from a searchable list
- Display shows real names and emails

## Code Changes Summary

### 5 Files Modified

1. **src/core/auth.py** - Added WSO2 user search functions
2. **src/core/database_service.py** - Added player creation/retrieval
3. **src/app/game_manager.py** - Added player ID tracking
4. **src/app/app.py** - Added new API endpoints
5. **templates/control.html** + **static/js/control.js** - Added UI for user search

### Key New Features

- **Autocomplete search** for WSO2 users as you type
- **Email display** alongside usernames
- **Player database storage** for history tracking
- **Fallback to manual entry** if needed
- **Full backward compatibility** with existing games

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Update Code

The fixes are already applied. Just verify:

```bash
cd /data/dartserver-pythonapp
python -m py_compile src/app/app.py
python -m py_compile src/core/auth.py
python -m py_compile src/core/database_service.py
```

### 2. Restart Docker Container

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Verify Changes

Access the application and test:

- Control panel player input
- Search for a WSO2 user
- Add player from search results
- Navigate to Game History page
- Check if game history displays

## What Users Will See

### Before

- Text input field for player name
- "Add Player" button
- No validation
- No email shown
- Empty history pages

### After

- Text input field with autocomplete
- As you type, list appears showing WSO2 users
- Shows user name and email
- Can click to select from list
- History pages now show your game records

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Type "d" in player field - see list appear
- [ ] Type full username - see matching user
- [ ] Click on user in dropdown - name populated
- [ ] Click "Add Player" - player added successfully
- [ ] Play a game
- [ ] Go to History page - game should appear
- [ ] Check Statistics - should show game count, wins, etc.

## Troubleshooting

### Users not appearing in search

- Ensure WSO2 is running and accessible
- Check `.env` file has correct WSO2 URLs
- Verify admin credentials in `.env`

### History page still empty

- Restart the application
- Clear browser cache
- Check Docker logs: `docker logs darts-app`

### Error when adding players

- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify WSO2 connectivity
- Look for errors in Docker logs

## Environment Variables Required

These should already be set in your `.env`:

```
WSO2_IS_URL=https://your-wso2-instance:9443
WSO2_IS_INTERNAL_URL=https://your-wso2-instance:9443
WSO2_IS_INTROSPECT_USER=admin
WSO2_IS_INTROSPECT_PASSWORD=your-password
WSO2_IS_VERIFY_SSL=false  # For local testing
```

## Database Notes

- No migration required - existing Player table already has username/email fields
- Backward compatible - old player records continue to work
- New players automatically stored with user info

## Performance Impact

- **None** on game functionality
- Added autocomplete search (debounced, 300ms)
- Very minimal database writes for player creation
- No slowdown of existing features
